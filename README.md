# SCARAB: Encrypted notetaking that runs on the terminal :D

## Files included:
#### `getexe.cmd`: Given the existing scrb.py file, and pyinstaller is installed in your system, this generates an .exe file for the application that can be easily ran, even without the Python intepreter installed.
#### `icon.ico`: An .ico file for the logo/icon of the app.
#### `scrb.py`: The python code for the app.
#### `scrb.exe`: the executable file for the app. If lost, running getexe.cmd will bring this back.

## Use as a standard app:
Scarab can be used like a normal PC application by double clicking on the .exe file and entering the commands. You can move it to anywhere you like and create desktop shortcuts to it. Scarab is entirely text-based and does not have a GUI. Type 'help' while within the app to see the full list of commands.

## Run in terminal:
